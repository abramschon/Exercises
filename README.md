# ML Basics
## Implementing Some Basic Machine Learning Methods

For sake of practice, we implement the following ML methods:

- Perceptron (binary and multi-class)
- Na√Øve Bayes
- Logistic Regression (binary and multi-class)
- Multilayer Perceptron / Feed Forward Neural Network

... More

We largely try implement these from scratch with a bit of help from `Numpy`. Where possible, we try visualise aspects of the models.
