# PCA, RG and Eigenfaces

In this project, I want to go through Principal Component Analyis (PCA), its relationship to the Renormalisation Group (RG), and hopefully visually aspects of this using a data-set of faces.

I have already made a Colab notebook on PCA, which is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1buuvuHPqJdeyk-tITETFGTHaL2W-zBzj).

This project is inspired by this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09733.pdf).
